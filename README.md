## About
Welcome to the SARScope Ship Detection project! ðŸŒŠ This repository is dedicated to detecting ships in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images using a FastRCNN model. Our goal is to accurately detect and classify each ship within an image. For more details on the FastRCNN model, check out the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497).

## Dataset
We use an open-source dataset from Kaggle for this project:
ðŸ“Š [SARScope: Unveiling the Maritime Landscape](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kailaspsudheer/sarscope-unveiling-the-maritime-landscape)

## Setup
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Download the repository to your local machine.
2. Update the path to the dataset in the Jupyter notebook file:
```
   base_path = 'YOUR_PATH'  # The data to your data
```

3. Ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Training Process
The model was trained using the following setup:
- **GPU**: Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 with 8GB RAM
- **Epochs**: 100

Here are some visualizations from the training process:

![mAP during the training](assets/map_score.png "mAP during the training")
![Loss during the training](assets/loss_training.png "Loss during the training")

The best model weights were achieved at epoch 64 (starting from 0).

## Limitations and Future Work
The current model has limitations, particularly with images containing multiple ships. Future improvements could include:
- ðŸ”¹ Adding more data
- ðŸ”¹ Enhancing data augmentation techniques
- ðŸ”¹ Experimenting with different model backbones
- ðŸ”¹ Fine-tuning hyperparameters
